# Ideas for projects

## Minecraft

### RpSystem 
Roleplay system for minecraft. I've already done one version of this but it is unoptimized and old.

### Stock Market - RpSystem addon
A stock market that would take a company's net worth (calculated by an algorithm) and its stock buying and selling value to increase or decrease its stock value. It could be a way to massively make money for players and it could be fun.

### Casino games
Simple casino games like roulette (Ingame, not in menu) etc.
